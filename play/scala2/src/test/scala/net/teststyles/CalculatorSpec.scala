// Structured, Nested, Described Tests: FunSpecs
// This style of testing is focused on testing specifications, i.e. behaviors. It still doesnâ€™t use the full
// expressiveness of Scala, but now we have more powerful testing structures:
//  - we can nest tests into one another
//  - we can add pinpoint descriptions to particular tests
// In ScalaTest, FunSpecs are used for structured, descriptive tests. The style is still similar to the above
// FunSuites, but we are now moving towards testing behaviors (BDD), which is more powerful and easy to reason about
// in large codebases.
