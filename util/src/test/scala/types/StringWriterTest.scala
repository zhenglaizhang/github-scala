/**
  * An intuitive way to reason about linearisation is to refer to the construction order and to visualise the linear hierarchy.
  * You could think this way. The base class is constructed first; but before being able of constructing the base
  * class, its superclasses/traits must be constructed first (this means construction starts at the top of the hierarchy). For each class in the hierarchy, mixed-in traits are constructed left-to-right because a trait on the right is added "later" and thus has the chance to "override" the previous traits. However, similarly to classes, in order to construct a trait, its base traits must be constructed first (obvious); and, quite reasonably, if a trait has already been constructed (anywhere in the hierarchy), it is not reconstructed again. Now, the construction order is the reverse of the linearisation. Think of "base" traits/classes as higher in the linear hierarchy, and traits lower in the hierarchy as closer to the class/object which is the subject of the linearisation. The linearisation affects how `superÂ´ is resolved in a trait: it will resolve to the closest base trait (higher in the hierarchy).
